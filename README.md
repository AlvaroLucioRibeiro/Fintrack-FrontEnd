## Flutter Installation
To set up this project, you first need to install Flutter on your computer. Follow the instructions on the official Flutter website by clicking [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to download and install Flutter.

After installing Flutter, add the Flutter SDK to your system's environment variables to make Flutter commands available in the terminal.

On Windows: add the path `C:\src\flutter\bin` to the PATH environment variable.

On macOS or Linux: add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:`flutter/bin`"
```

Once you've completed the Flutter installation and setup, proceed to run the project.
